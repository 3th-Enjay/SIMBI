## Getting Started
``
### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
* npm or yarn package manager
* MongoDB database (local or hosted)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
   
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd SIMBI
    
2.  Install dependencies:
   
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
  ```  
### Environment Variables

1.  Create a .env file in the root directory of the project.
2.  Copy the content from the (optional) .env.example file and fill in your database connection string and a JWT secret.

   
    # .env example
    DATABASE_URL="mongodb://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database>" # Replace with your MongoDB connection string
    JWT_SECRET="a_very_secure_simbi_secret_for_jwt_signing"         # CHANGE THIS TO A STRONG, UNIQUE SECRET
    PORT=3000                                                        # Port for the server to listen on
    ENCRYPTION_KEY=my_encryption-key
    EMAIL_USER=nellg.gc@gmail.com
    EMAIL_PASS= email-pass-key
    GEMINI_API_KEY=api-key
    OPENROUTER_API_KEY=open_router-api-key
    
### Database Setup

Ensure your MongoDB database is running and accessible via the DATABASE_URL provided in your .env file. Mongoose will automatically create the collections (like users, studyplans, studysessions, quiz, quizHistory) when you save documents to them for the first time based on the defined models.

### Running the Server

* Development Mode (with nodemon and TypeScript compilation):
   
    npm run dev
    
    This will compile your TypeScript code and start the server. Nodemon will watch for file changes and automatically restart the server.

* Production Mode (build and run):
   
    npm run build
    
    This compiles the TypeScript code into the dist directory.

   
    npm start
    
    This runs the compiled JavaScript code from the dist directory.

## API Endpoints

The API is served at the base URL configured in your .env file (default: http://localhost:3000). All API routes are prefixed with /api.

Refer to the Swagger API Documentation for a detailed list of available endpoints, request/response schemas, and how to interact with them.

## Streak Tracking Details

The daily streak is a core feature encouraging consistent engagement.

* How it's tracked: Each User document in the database has currentStreak, longestStreak, and lastStudyDate fields. lastStudyDate stores the timestamp of the last action that counted towards the streak.
* How it's updated: The updateStreak function in src/utils/streak.utils.ts calculates the new streak values by comparing the current day to lastStudyDate.
* When it's triggered: The updateUserLastStudyDate function in src/services/user.service.ts calls updateStreak and saves the result to the database. This service function is called from:
    * The login controller (auth.controller.ts) upon successful login.
    * The createStudyPlan service (studyPlan.service.ts) after a study plan is saved.
    * The recordQuizAttempts service (quiz.service.ts) if the quiz attempt is marked as "passed".
* Daily Window: The streak logic considers a "day" from midnight to midnight based on the server's local time (or potentially timezone-aware if you enhance the date-fns usage with timezones, which date-fns-tz supports). Performing a streak-eligible action any time within a 24-hour calendar day (starting from midnight) will count for that day. Subsequent actions on the same day will not increment the streak further for that day.

## API Documentation (Swagger UI)

Interactive API documentation is available once the server is running.

1.  Start the server (npm run dev or npm start).
2.  Open your web browser and navigate to:
   
    `http://localhost:3000/api-docs`
    
    (Replace 3000 if you configured a different port in your .env file).

This interface allows you to explore all endpoints, view request/response schemas, and even test the API directly.

## Contributing

1.  Clone the repository:
   ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd SIMBI
    ```

2.  Install dependencies:
   ```bash
    npm install
    or 
    npm i
    ```
 
 3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
     PORT= your port
     MONGO_URI=database url
     ENCRYPTION_KEY=encryption key
     JWT_SECRET=jwt secret
     EMAIL_USER=email
     EMAIL_PASS=email-pass-key
     GEMINI_API_KEY= your-api-key
     OPENROUTER_API_KEY= your-router-api-key
